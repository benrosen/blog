I worked as a host at a fancy restaurant for a few months right after highschool. During slow shifts, I would do chess puzzles to pass the time. The book of puzzles I had was huge. I guess I didn't have a phone yet because I remember lugging [that giant hardcover book][1] to work on my bike every day. It was a workout.

Anyway, I recently got back into chess when some of my students discovered the game for the first time through Twitch.

So, naturally, now I want to try to build my own chess game.

Rather than release the whole project at once when it's finished, I'm going to release "modules" as I complete them. Here's the first release: [a set of 16x16 pixel art chess pieces][2]. The sprites are free for commercial use and no attribution is required.

I had fun making these sprites. It was a bite-sized creative challenge to represent each piece with so few pixels. Perhaps they'll come in handy for someone besides myself.
