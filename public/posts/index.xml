      <description>I spend a lot of time at work helping people who are new to game development. There are many excellent options for beginners who are interested in creating games, from Scratch to processing to Unity. These days, one of my favorite ways to make games is with Phaser. Phaser is easy to set up, and it has lots of great examples to work from. Phaser also has plenty of convenient features that make other game engines (looking at you, Unity) seem kind of clunky in comparison.</description>

      <description>I worked as a host at a fancy restaurant for a few months right after highschool. During slow shifts, I would do chess puzzles to pass the time. The book of puzzles I had was huge. I guess I didn&amp;rsquo;t have a phone yet because I remember lugging that giant hardcover book to work on my bike every day. It was a workout.
Anyway, I recently got back into chess when some of my students discovered the game for the first time through Twitch.</description>
