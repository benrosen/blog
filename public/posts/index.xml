      <description>I worked as a host at a fancy restaurant for a few months right after highschool. During slow shifts, I would do chess puzzles to pass the time. The book of puzzles I had was huge. I guess I didn&amp;rsquo;t have a phone yet because I remember lugging that giant hardcover book to work on my bike every day. It was a workout.
Anyway, I recently got back into chess when some of my students discovered the game for the first time through Twitch.</description>
